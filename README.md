USAGE: A time app that includes a clock that shows the current time, a timer that accepts user input then counts to zero and beeps, and a stopwatch. This app uses a single reusable component for displaying the time. Depending on the mode, it displays the meridiem and milliseconds field and allows user input.

Clock: Gets and displays the current time using the JavaScript Date object.

Timer: Accepts user input and counts down to zero and then plays a beeping noise. The timer can be paused and canceled.

Stopwatch: A typical stopwatch that can be started, stopped, and reset. Lap times can also be recorded.
